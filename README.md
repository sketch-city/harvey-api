The Harvey Needs API
====================

* Imports data from a public google data spreadsheet
* Each import does a full import of the needs and shelter sheets
* We serve JSON data here, open and fresh
* viasocket notifies our api when changes have been made to the source data in Google sheets. The api then does a full refresh of the data from the Google sheet.will post to us when an update is posted to the google spreadsheet
* An ad-hoc import can be triggered with `rails google:import`

Filters:

* `county` : County Name

* `limit`: only return n results



Sample:
`/api/v1/shelters?county=fort bend&accepting=true`

  * Filters by fort bend shelters accepting people

`/api/v1/shelters?shelter=Gallery`

  * Filters shelters with Gallery in the name

Getting Started (Dev)
-------

You'll need to set the following ENV variables in a .env file

1. `cp .env.sample .env`
2. `atom .env` to edit the VARS
3. Get a server credential from google for
   https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/drive.googleapis.com/overview
4. Get the private key and email from the json file google gets you
5. Those are the ENV to use


Development Process
-------
### Git and Github use
#### Forking a repository for yourself
##### Initial fork for you work
* Prequisites
  * A github account and a repository into which to fork other repoistories
* Steps
  *
(Coming soon)

##### Creating a local instance
`git clone git@github.com:<YOUR OWN GITHUB REPOSITORY>/harvey-api.git`

##### Keeping your fork in sync
* `git remote add upstream git@github.com:sketch-city/harvey-api.git`
* `git pull upstream`

#### Branching
With your own forked repo we strongly recommend that you create branches for each logical unit for work you do.

#### Pull Requests

##### More Information and Further Reading
* More information about keeping your fork in sync with the upstream repository may be found at https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/
* More information about branching can be found at https://git-scm.com/book/id/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell



Documentation Standards
-------
### Inline comment style
(Coming Soon)

### Markdown
Documentation such as READMEs (e.g., this document) are written in markdown per the [Github standard] (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)


Design Choices
-------------

* one benefit of building our own api is so that we can get rid of using
  google-sheets eventually.
* Hosted on Heroku and Amazon RDS

Thanks To:
---------

* Entire Sketch-City organization
* Coding for America
* More More More names here
